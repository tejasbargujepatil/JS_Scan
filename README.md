# Website JavaScript Extraction and Sensitive Information Scanner

Developed by Tejas Barguje Patil,
this toolkit enables users to extract and scan JavaScript files on websites for sensitive information.
 With clear usage instructions and licensing details,
it offers a comprehensive solution for web developers and security professionals.

## Usage

 1. JavaScript File Extraction

Run `js_files_scanner.py` to **extract JavaScript files from a website**. Provide the website's URL when prompted.
use following command to run tool and then enter full URL of website e.g. https://www.example.com/
```
python js_files_scanner.py
```

 2. Sensitive Information Scanning

Execute `js_sensitive_info_scanner.py` to **scan JavaScript files for sensitive information**.
Provide the file containing JavaScript URLs obtained previously.
for this you need to save all links in .txt files so this will help you

e.g. "F:\[Filename.txt]
```
python js_sensitive_info_scanner.py
```

 3. Link-based Sensitive Data Analysis

for JavaScript links** within the website.

```
python
# Add your sensitive information scanning logic here
def scan_js_link_sensitive_info(url):
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Call the function with appropriate arguments if needed
    pass
```
